# Known issues & leads

## Open

- **Inventory-open aspect flicker** (2026-07-13): opening the inventory makes
  the game EFB-capture the frame and redraw it as a background; during the
  handoff emu64's NOOP markers switch `g_pc_widescreen_stretch`
  (0=hor+ → 1=stretch for bg blits → 2=UI pillarbox; reset to 0 each frame
  in pc_gx_begin_frame). The captured letterboxed image and the blit mode
  disagree for 1-2 frames → visible width jump. Where to look:
  emu64.c `dl_G_NOOP` (marker handling), m_play.c ~688/738 (marker emission),
  pc_gx.c GXSetProjection/GXSetViewport mode-2 remap, EFB capture path in
  pc_gx_copy_tex_execute / GXLoadTexObj bypass. Fix needs device A/B.
- **Main-area perf — NEXT TARGET: per-draw GL overhead** (2026-07-13,
  measured on device): steady frames 42ms with gl=25ms at 491-600 draws
  (~40-50µs/draw), tex=0.0 (texture pipeline fully solved), speed 94-100%
  (dynamic fps working). emu64 -O2 experiment SHIPPED SAFE (train passes,
  crashes=0) and improved home area 36→35-40 fps. PERF-tab toggles don't
  matter because draw dispatch, not scene volume, is the cost. Leads, in
  order: (1) per-draw glBufferData orphan → one big VBO with offset
  accumulation per frame; (2) uniform re-upload on shader switch
  (dirty=ALL) → per-program uniform value shadowing so unchanged values
  skip upload; (3) why do 500+ draws survive merging — likely
  GXLoadTexObj-driven flushes; consider binding-change-only fast path that
  doesn't break the batch when the texture object is identical.
- **One-time 8.7s stall on home menu** (device log frame 606: work=8746ms,
  gl=13ms, tex=0): pure game-side stall — synchronous iso reads
  (pc_disc/pc_dvd fread on SD) and/or decompression in unoptimized decomp
  code during menu/save load. Leads: add timing counters to pc_dvd_read /
  pc_disc reads, consider read-ahead thread or optimizing the decomp's
  decompression TUs (same per-TU -O2 pattern as emu64).

## Resolved (keep for pattern-matching)

- Intro train black screen → decomp code must build unoptimized (kb/perf.md).
- First-boot menu music stutter → shader seed warmup during splash.
- No audio → 32-bit PipeWire env in launcher (kb/device.md).
- Game running at 57% speed under load → fps_target must be dynamic (6);
  fixed targets tie game logic to render rate.
